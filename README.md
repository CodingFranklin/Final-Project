# Final-Project

# Pizza Eaters
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2025

## Theme: You only get one
-We interpreted the theme as you only get one life
-And that the main character is only one slice of pizza
-It means we can't be greedy, focus on the target that we can achieve first.

## Game Play
-Reach the top to reunite with your pizza, while avoiding zombie toppings and collecting friends to give you a jump boost.

## Impediments

-Game is harder than originally thought.
-The purpose of the enemies
-Animation for the character is harder then expected
-We lost everything and we got it.
